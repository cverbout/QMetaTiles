The area for observation in these maps is the United States. Starting at a very broad country-wide focus and allowing the user to zoom in to a broad state level view.

The zoom capabilites afforded by this map range from minimum of 4 to a maximum of 7. At 4 there is a general view of the United States showing all 48 landlocked states. Moving to 7 the user can center a whole state on their screen providing a more specific focus. Each tile set is capable of meeting this range of 4 to 7 which was determined to be the optimal range for the data that is presented.

**Tile Set 1:** Dark Terrain
